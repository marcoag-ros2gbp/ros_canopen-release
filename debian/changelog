ros-melodic-socketcan-bridge (0.6.5-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * hamonized versions
  * styled and sorted CMakeLists.txt
    * removed boilerplate comments
    * indention
    * reviewed exported dependencies
  * styled and sorted package.xml
  * Removes gtest from test dependencies.
    This dependency is covered by the rosunit dependency.
  * Removes dependency on Boost, adds rosunit dependency.
    The dependency on Boost was unnecessary, rosunit is required for gtest.
  * Improves StateInterface implementation of the DummyInterface.
    The doesLoopBack() method now returns the correct value. A state change is
    correctly dispatched when the init() method is called.
  * Changes the exit code of the nodes if device init fails.
    Now exits with 1 if the initialization of the can device fails.
  * Changes the frame field for the published messages.
    An empty frame name is more commonly used to denote that there is no frame
    associated with the message.
  * Changes return type of setup() method.
    Setup() calls the CreateMsgListener and CreateStateListener, it does not attempt
    to verify if the interface is ready, which makes void more applicable.
  * Cleanup, fixes and improvements in CmakeLists.
    Adds the REQUIRED COMPONENTS packages to the CATKIN_DEPENDS.
    Improves add_dependency on the messages to be built.
    Removes unnecessary FILES_MATCHING.
    Moves the roslint_cpp macro to the testing block.
  * Finalizes work on the socketcan_bridge and can_msgs.
    Readies the packages socketcan_bridge and can_msgs for the merge with ros_canopen.
    Bumps the version for both packages to 0.1.0. Final cleanup in CMakeLists, added
    comments to the shell script and launchfile used for testing.
  * Adds tests for socketcan_bridge and bugfixes.
    Uses rostests and the modified DummyInterface to test whether behaviour
    is correct. Prevented possible crashes when can::tostring was called on
    invalid frames.
  * Adds conversion test between msg and SocketCAN Frame.
    This test only covers the conversion between the can_msgs::Frame message and can::Frame from SocketCAN.
  * Introduces topic_to_socketcan and the bridge.
    Adds TopicToSocketCAN, the counterpart to the SocketCANToTopic class.
    Also introduces a node to use this class and a node which combines the two
    classes into a bidirectional bridge.
    Contrary to the previous commit message the send() method appears to be
    available from the ThreadedSocketCANInterface afterall.
  * Introduces socketcan_to_topic and its node.
    This is based on the ThreadedSocketCANInterface from the socketcan_interface package. Sending might become problematic with this class however, as the send() method is not exposed through the Threading wrappers.
